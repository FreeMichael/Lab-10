**Challenge Steganography

With the kenny.png file we open it up in notepad, when looking at the metadata we see at the bottom pmmfpffmfpp which is the way kenny from South Park speaks. Nick looks up a kenny translator which will actually translate the gibberish at the bottom of the metadata to dissolve which is the secret message.

**Challenge A SE Anecdote

This man had a twitter account named @N which was very sought after being only a single letter account. An attacker used a vishing attack to get the last 4 of the user's credit card which he then used to get access to the user's godaddy.com account which was the user's email connected to all his accounts including his twitter. He then took access of the godaddy.com account and told the user to give up his twitter tag in order to get his godaddy.com account back which he did. This shows the attacker used a vishing attack with social engineering.

**Challenge Phishing

I set up a fake facebook page using setoolkit and hosted it on the local host, then by accessing the site and putting in fake credentials. I was able to pick up these credentials in the kali terminal.
